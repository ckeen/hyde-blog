The code for my small blog

* About

This repository contains the code parts for my [[http://pestilenz.org/~ckeen/blog][blog]].  It is written
with [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/egg/hyde][Hyde]] a static website compiler written in the [[http://call-with-current-continuation][CHICKEN scheme]]
programming language.

* Installation

After cloning this repo you will need a chicken scheme package for
your system. See the [[http://wiki.call-cc.org/platforms][Platforms & packages]] page on the Chicken Wiki for
an appropriate package for your operating system. Then install hyde
using /chicken-install/ which will pull in hyde with all its
dependencies:

  chicken-install hyde

then compile the site calling /hyde/ in the root directory of the
repo. You can also call /hyde serve/ which will open up a webserver on
port 8080 which allows you to experiment on the data. Each page will
be regenerated upon a new request.
